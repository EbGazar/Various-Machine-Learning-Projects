Applying Machine Learning algorithms for various applications using regression and classification techniques.

## Iris Flowers Classifier 💡.

##### Project Overview:

The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The columns in this dataset are:

* ` Id,`
* ` SepalLengthCm,`
* ` SepalWidthCm,`
* ` PetalLengthCm,`
* ` PetalWidthCm,`
* ` Species,`

## Housing Price Competetion 💡.

#### Project Overview:

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

## Melbourne Housing 💡.

#### Project Overview:

Melbourne real estate is BOOMING.
It was scraped from publicly available results posted every week from Domain.com.au, The dataset includes Address, Type of Real estate, Suburb, Method of Selling, Rooms, Price, Real Estate Agent, Date of Sale and distance from C.B.D.

N/A - price or highest bid not available.
* Type: br - bedroom(s); h - house,cottage,villa, semi,terrace; u - unit, duplex; t - townhouse; dev site - development site; o res - other residential.
* SellerG: Real Estate Agent
* Date: Date sold
* Distance: Distance from CBD
